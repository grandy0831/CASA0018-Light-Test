## Introduction

This project aims to develop a voice-controlled system for the classic game Snake. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technologies, voice interaction is becoming an integral and efficient mode of everyday interaction. Inspired by trends in modern interactive technologies, this project explores the potential of voice recognition in game control by enabling directional commands such as "up," "down," "left," and "right" to manipulate game movements.

The game control system captures the player's voice commands through an integrated microphone, processes and recognizes them in real-time, and translates them into movement controls within the game. This interaction allows the player to seamlessly control the game using voice alone, without the need for physical controllers, creating a new gaming experience.

### Key Inspiration:
1. **Smart Assistants**: The everyday use of devices like Alexa and Google Home reflects the reliability and user-friendliness of voice-controlled systems.
2. **Voice Recognition in Apps**: Mobile applications utilizing voice commands are becoming commonplace, demonstrating the technology's versatility.
3. **Accessible Gaming**: The concept of making gaming accessible to everyone, regardless of physical capability, showcases the profound impact of inclusive design principles.

Through this project, I hope to explore the wider use of speech technology in entertainment and open up new possibilities for accessible game design.


## Research Question

The core question of this project is:

**"How can voice recognition technology be effectively applied to control the game Snake, enabling hands-free operation with response times and accuracy that meet the demands of real-time gameplay?"**

In addition, the project will investigate the feasibility and performance optimization strategies for using deep learning models on resource-constrained embedded systems to process voice commands.


## Application Overview

This project develops a voice-controlled Snake game that consists of several key components:

- **Voice Recognition Module:** This module collects audio through a microphone, capturing short commands such as "up," "down," "left," and "right," along with background noise and non-command sounds.
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:** This involves processing the audio data to clip effective commands and extracting sound features using techniques like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).
- **Deep Learning Model Training and Evaluation:** Utilizes various network architectures, such as 1D-CNN, on the Edge Impulse platform to train and evaluate models, aiming to improve recognition accuracy and response speed.
- **Command Execution Interface:** Deploys the trained model onto an embedded device (e.g., Arduino) and performs real-time recognition of user commands to control the direction of the Snake game.

The design focuses on model light-weighting and inference speed optimization to adapt to the computational capabilities of embedded devices while ensuring the smoothness and interactivity of the game experience.

## Data

### Data Collection

The dataset for this project comprises six types of audio samples: command instructions ("up," "down," "left," "right"), "unknown" (random words), and "noise" (various background noises). Command samples were collected using smartphone microphones from 15 participants of diverse nationalities, genders, ages, and accents to enhance dataset diversity and improve the model's generalization capabilities. "Unknown" and "noise" samples were sourced from Edge Impulse's keyword spotting audio sample library (Edge Impulse, 2023a).

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps included:

1. **Sample Clipping:** Cutting out segments containing a keyword from longer audio files to ensure each clip contains only one clear command or noise.

3. **Duration Standardization:** All audio clips were processed to uniform length to maintain consistency during feature extraction.
4. **Label Annotation:** Each audio clip was accurately labelled to ensure precise correspondence between training data and labels.

### Dataset Construction

Approximately 300 samples per command were collected as raw data. Using the Edge Impulse platform, this data was automatically divided into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set. This division ratio helps the model learn sufficient features while retaining enough data to validate the model's generalization ability.

### Feature Extraction

Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) techniques were employed to extract features from the audio. MFCC is extensively used in audio signal processing, particularly suitable for capturing qualitative characteristics of speech and music. It simulates the auditory perception of human ears, effectively capturing the short-term energy variations and spectral structure of audio signals, making it the preferred feature for sound recognition tasks(M. Rammo and N. Al-Hamdani, 2022).


## Model

### Overview of the Model

This project employs deep learning techniques for the classification and recognition of audio signals. To enhance the model's performance and adapt it to different application scenarios, three distinct network architectures were experimented with:

1. **One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN):** Designed for one-dimensional temporal data, this architecture effectively extracts temporal features from audio signals by applying filters along the time axis, making it suitable for real-time processing of lengthy audio streams.
2. **Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN):** Primarily used for processing two-dimensional spatial data, such as images and spectrograms. In this project, audio signals are transformed into spectrograms, which are then processed by 2D-CNNs to capture the frequency domain features of the audio.
3. **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2):** Utilizes the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to leverage knowledge learned on large-scale datasets, enhancing the model's generalization ability and performance.

### Model Comparison and Selection

- **Data Characteristics:** Given the temporal features of audio data, 1D-CNNs naturally excel in processing time-series data.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Experimental results show that 1D-CNNs have much faster inference times compared to 2D-CNNs and MobileNetV2, which is crucial for scenarios requiring quick responses.
- **Resource Utilization:** 1D-CNNs consume less peak RAM compared to 2D-CNNs and MobileNetV2, demonstrating higher applicability on resource-constrained devices.
- **Performance Comparison:** Although 1D-CNNs and 2D-CNNs are similar in accuracy, 1D-CNNs offer significant advantages in inference speed and resource usage. While MobileNetV2 offers higher accuracy, its longer inference times and greater resource demands limit its application in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.

<br><br>![Model](https://github.com/grandy0831/DL4SN-Voice-Controlled-Gluttonous-snake/assets/140076679/c203b690-1860-4c62-aa55-77e277749a49)


This configuration ensured high accuracy (Test Accuracy: 94.02%) while maintaining low resource consumption and fast inference times, making it highly suitable for the real-time audio processing needs of my voice-controlled Gluttonous Snake game. Extensive testing of model performance under different parameter configurations showed that this setup offered the best performance, demonstrating excellent generalisation ability and efficiency.



## Results and Observations

In this project, the deep learning model was successfully deployed on Arduino Nano 33 BLE, and the performance of the voice-controlled Snake game on physical devices was explored. The model can receive voice commands through the microphone and respond accurately in less than half a second, converting them into game control commands. Additionally, five experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of different factors on system performance: accuracy, sound level, speaking speed, distance, and noise environment.

### 1. Accuracy Tests
Testing with new users who were not part of the training dataset, the model demonstrated strong generalisation abilities with overall accuracies between 85% to 87% (Figure 11). Commands "right" and "left" achieved higher recognition accuracies (above 92%) due to their distinct syllable structures and clearer pronunciations, while "up" and "down" commands showed lower accuracies, which may be attributed to their monosyllabic nature that could lead to less distinct vocal representations.

![Figure 11. Accuracy test records](https://github.com/grandy0831/DL4SN-Voice-Controlled-Gluttonous-snake/assets/140076679/8be4e1d2-7ac3-40b7-9688-520749b2ad80)

### 2. Sound Level Impact
The model performed best at moderate sound levels (70 dB), where the accuracy peaked at 85%, including 98% for "right" direction commands (Figure 12). At higher levels (85 dB), accuracy dropped significantly to 67%, indicating that excessive volume might distort signal integrity or overwhelm the microphone's processing capabilities.

![Figure 12. Sound Level test records](https://github.com/grandy0831/DL4SN-Voice-Controlled-Gluttonous-snake/assets/140076679/eae48801-d021-41f4-9a36-7ecec06930b5)

### 3. Speaking Speed Effects
Faster speech rates had the highest accuracy (87%), reflecting typical command speeds in gaming scenarios. Slow rates reduced overall accuracy to 81% (Figure 13), with significant drops for "down" and "left" commands, possibly due to vowel lengthening or changes in command dynamics.

![Figure 13. Speaking Rate test records](https://github.com/grandy0831/DL4SN-Voice-Controlled-Gluttonous-snake/assets/140076679/c7329fd6-034f-481b-868c-39673af0968a)

### 4. Distance Challenges
System performance degrades as the distance increases from 0.1 meters (accuracy 92%) to 1 meter (accuracy 82%) (Figure 14). This trend illustrates the challenges of capturing and processing attenuated audio signals as distance increases.

![Figure 14. Distance test records](https://github.com/grandy0831/DL4SN-Voice-Controlled-Gluttonous-snake/assets/140076679/efa83563-b454-4635-b467-ddc2a9a91f82)

### 5. Noise Environment
Surprisingly, moderate background noise (45 dB to 69 dB) improved recognition accuracy, peaking at 99% for human voices at 45 dB (Figure 15). However, high-intensity noise (75 dB), particularly from construction environments, severely impacted accuracy (dropping to 59%), illustrating the limits of the system's noise handling capabilities. Moderate background noise can help improve recognition accuracy, but excessive noise sources must be avoided.

![Figure 15. Noise Environment test records](https://github.com/grandy0831/DL4SN-Voice-Controlled-Gluttonous-snake/assets/140076679/8cbedfd4-77e3-4167-a263-a00a24b7322e)

## Reflections and Next Steps

These experiments demonstrate the system's ability to effectively process real-time audio input, although the degree of success varies depending on environmental conditions. Potential improvements include:
- **Command Modification:** Replace single-syllable commands such as "up" and "down" with more distinct, multi-syllable commands to enhance recognition accuracy.
- **Adding Background Music:** Introducing appropriate background noise, such as music, can improve recognition accuracy while making the game more engaging.
- **Game Mechanics Enhancement:** Improve the gaming experience by using larger displays or deploying the model on smartphones with game development software.

These strategies not only aim to boost the model's performance and enhance user engagement but also provide a foundation for further research into accessible interactive games.
