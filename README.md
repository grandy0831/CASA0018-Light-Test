## Introduction

This project aims to develop a voice-controlled system for the classic game Snake. With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technologies, voice interaction is becoming an integral and efficient mode of everyday interaction. Inspired by trends in modern interactive technologies, this project explores the potential of voice recognition in game control by enabling directional commands such as "up," "down," "left," and "right" to manipulate game movements.

The game control system captures the player's voice commands through an integrated microphone, processes and recognizes them in real-time, and translates them into movement controls within the game. This interaction allows the player to seamlessly control the game using voice alone, without the need for physical controllers, creating a new gaming experience.

### Key Inspiration:
1. **Smart Assistants**: The everyday use of devices like Alexa and Google Home reflects the reliability and user-friendliness of voice-controlled systems.
2. **Voice Recognition in Apps**: Mobile applications utilizing voice commands are becoming commonplace, demonstrating the technology's versatility.
3. **Accessible Gaming**: The concept of making gaming accessible to everyone, regardless of physical capability, showcases the profound impact of inclusive design principles.

Through this project, I hope to explore the wider use of speech technology in entertainment and open up new possibilities for accessible game design.


## Research Question

The core question of this project is:

**"How can voice recognition technology be effectively applied to control the game Snake, enabling hands-free operation with response times and accuracy that meet the demands of real-time gameplay?"**

In addition, the project will investigate the feasibility and performance optimization strategies for using deep learning models on resource-constrained embedded systems to process voice commands.


## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
